Flatemate Finder is a team project for ICS 314: Software Engineering. The [five of us](https://flatmatefinder.xyz/meettheteam) created a web application that provides a simple solution for students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to find a desirable roommate. The main frameworks and languages we used throughout the development of this project were React, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, Meteor, and MongoDB. In addition, we used Github for version control and to faciliate our issue driven project development method. I learned that teamwork and communication is salient in the development of web applications and that maintaining a stable framework to facilitate issues is important. Throughout the team project, I contributed by:
- Setting up the Digital Ocean hosting
- Create a Meet the Team page
- Set up a Custom Domain Name and HTTPS
- Set up a suspension system
- Create the admin profile page
- Dynamically display total number of users
- Display suggestions on admin landing page
- Create contact us page
