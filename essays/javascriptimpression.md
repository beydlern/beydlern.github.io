*The human mind is a journey from clay to a complete molded form.*

## Impressions

Using FreeCodeCamp, a wonderful non-profit organization with interactive learning web platforms to learn to code in different languages for free, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript: objects, looping, functions, variables, conditional logic, and arrays. The syntax of the language is relaxed and it is *weakly typed* in the sense that variables can hold any type of object, which in itself is a double-edged sword. Furthermore, an interesting and core concept of the language is that functions are first class meaning that functions behave like any other object and can be assigned to a variable: functions can be used as arguments in other functions, you can store functions as dictionary values, or return a function from another function, etc. I believe that these core concepts allow beginner and advanced programmers to intuitively program in JavaScript.

## Analysis

JavaScript is the first web-based language that I have formally studied, then with respect to general-purpose programming languages (e.g. C++, C, Java) the fact that it is dynamically typed makes it more accessible, but easier to mess up than the statically typed languages as variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile time.
