<p><em>The purpose of life is a life of purpose.</em></p>

<h2 id="adrift">Adrift</h2>

<p>When I graduated high school, I found myself with no real purpose in life, so I chose to follow the normal dreams of others; applying for college, graduating college, and working in industry. I did not know what major I wanted to study, so I initially chose liberal arts, but then quickly realized it seemed unfulfilling and I felt further adrift.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>After playing a multitude of video games, I delved further into the underlying structure of video games, especially physics, and the amount of effort to produce them was the culmination of true software development and teamwork. I truly felt inspired to pursue this, which subsequently led to me pursuing computer science and physics. After a few years of taking courses, my ability to understand and apply physics in a game engine environment and apply my newfound knowledge of programming to any project I want to pursue has given me a sense of purpose and the hope that I have found my purpose in life: computer science.</p>

<h2 id="present">Present</h2>

<p>I am currently attending UH Manoa and still pursuing my degree in computer science, and with every day that passes I feel more fulfilled as I learn more. I hope to never stop learning and keep applying my knowledge to any project that I desire. I am eager to finally collaborate with my peers who have also decided computer science was their purpose.</p>
