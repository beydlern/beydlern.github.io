## Overview

*The problem:* To prepare for working in industry or to further one's own academic pursuits, students often require internships or working positions in their field of study. However, marketing themselves for these temporary positions is often perplexing.

- Student home page.
- Company home page
- Admin home page
- Student profile page.
- Browse students by skill, geographic preference, etc via a search option.
