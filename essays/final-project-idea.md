Admins may edit each student page to remove inappropriate content new categories of skills.

Companies looking for students may login and contact students who pique their interest.

- Landing page
- Student home page.
- Company home page
- Admin home page
- Student profile page.
- Browse students by skill, geographic preference, etc via a search option.
