*Inquiry-based learning pushes the learner to new domains of knowledge*

## Communication
Communication is one of the most salient software engineering skills to develop, and inquiring the "right way" is one, if not, the most important communication skills for software engineers. 

# Inquiry
StackOverflow is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers: questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. As a software engineer, you will be asking a multitude of questions throughout your programming journey, but learning through asking these questions is one of the best forms of learning. However, asking your questions on sites like StackOverflow for the highest chance of being answered correctly and succinctly require you to ask it the "right way". Eric Raymond, a famous american programmer, created a [list of guidelines to ask questions in the most efficient manner](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Following these guidelines will help to construct your question and hopefully obtain a satisfying answer in a timely manner. In addition, guidelines aren't enough sometimes, thus the following text will present two StackOverflow questions asked by users: one question that followed the guidelines and one question that did not follow the guidelines.

## Right Way
In [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2402593/whats-the-reason-for-leaving-an-extra-blank-line-at-the-end-of-a-code-file) asked by the user Pops, he asks "What's the reason for leaving an extra blank line at the end of a code file?" and provides his personal experience with extra blank lines added in by his IDEs such as Eclipse and MyEclipse as well as the extra blank lines being prevalent in code. In addition, he notes that he was a former human language editor and he includes his analysis that these new lines seem irrevelant, but asks if there are any benefits to having the extra blank line. He was answered roughly three minutes after posting, which was then followed by three other answers that further investigated the blank end line at the end of code files with each answer building off of the previous answer and adding new information on top of the old. However, the first answer is satisfactory and provides a clear and logical reason for the extra blank line at the end of code files. This question follows the precepts in the guidelines by Raymond: easy to reply, clear and correctly-spelled language, precise and informative about the problem
